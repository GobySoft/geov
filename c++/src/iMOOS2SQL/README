readme for iMOOS2SQL

this process is a program running under the MOOS robotic control
software system developed by paul newman:
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/%7Epnewman/TheMOOS/index.html

> compilation:
you will need libmysqlclient15-dev (MySQL client developer library)

> usage:
iMOOS2SQL file.moos [name to register with moos]

an example .moos configuration file (with comments) is provided
in this directory.

this process may also be launched by pAntler.

> purpose:
takes AIS_REPORT variables from the local MOOSDB and imports them into a MySQL
database for the purpose of geov (google earth ocean viewer).

this process adds to the functionality of pAIS2SQL (and thus replaces it).
