You will need the php command line interface to run the 
em3000.php. 

In Ubuntu this is 
> sudo apt-get install php-cli

then you can convert the EM3000 contour.daf file to a kml file (here "example.kml") by running

./em3000.php contour.daf > example.kml

then you can open example.kml in Google Earth
